- Get data from Sentinel-Hub: NDVI time series
- Detect forest perturbations
- Process results
- Auto-generate website page

## Roadmap

#### Forest perturbation detection

- Handle water proximity
- Handle small holes
- Use optimal local threshold

#### Processing

- get CR per year
- get CR dataframe function

#### App

- display map over time
-
